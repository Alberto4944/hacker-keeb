## 10/22/2025 - Believe I finished the pcb!  

### **What I Did**
I worked on the schematic, and pcb. I did a bunch of research of what footprints and things to use, and settled upon using choc switches + hotswap sockets. I am using the Xiao nrf52840 (i was thinking of using the supermini from aliexpress, but I think I will just use my own money to buy the mcu).

### **Next Steps**
Next will be the case and firmware!

### **Issues Faced**
I had some troubles with the diodes and where to place them, but in the end I think they will work.![Screenshot 2025-08-16 230236.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDYzOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--39a34a360d0bbc2bcee5fa377da9070b770a34c9/Screenshot%202025-08-16%20230236.png)
