## 10/22/2025 10:13 PM - Believe I finished the pcb!  

### **What I Did**
I worked on the schematic, and pcb. I did a bunch of research of what footprints and things to use, and settled upon using choc switches + hotswap sockets. I am using the Xiao nrf52840 (i was thinking of using the supermini from aliexpress, but I think I will just use my own money to buy the mcu).

### **Next Steps**
Next will be the case and firmware!

### **Issues Faced**
I had some troubles with the diodes and where to place them, but in the end I think they will work.![Screenshot 2025-08-16 230236.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDYzOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--39a34a360d0bbc2bcee5fa377da9070b770a34c9/Screenshot%202025-08-16%20230236.png)

## 10/22/2025 10:16 PM - Finished the PCB  

**### What I Did**
Kind of forgot to make a devlog but I finished the pcb. I made big changes in my plan and ended up doing the following: 1. Switched from the Xiao BLE to the Supermini on Aliexpress to save costs 2. Went with Choc V1 only footprints/switches 3. Added the power switch, battery, and reset switch.

**### Next Steps**
The case!

**### Issues Faced**
Had difficulty figuring out which battery and mcu I was going to use.

## 10/22/2025 10:18 PM - Almost Done the Case  

### **What I Did**
I did a whole bunch of work on the case and plate. I've been mostly working on the left side (but I will just flip for the right). I have made screw holes and mostly calculated the dimensions. I am realizing I need to flip the side that the power/reset switches are on (top > bottom). Hopefully tomorrow I can finish it!

### **Next Steps**
Finishing the case and making a BOM!

### **Issues Faced**
Had difficulties with the screw holes but eventually got it figured out.

## 10/22/2025 10:19 PM - Basically done the case  

### **What I Did**
I worked on the case a lot, and flipped the power/reset switch on the pcb. Since I'm using shapr3d I did some visualization.

### **Next Steps**
- Make a cutout for the supermini nrf52840 - Make cutouts for the power/reset switch

### **Issues Faced**
Had troubles figuring out how big my battery is going to be. I think I am still going to settle with a 2000mah ps3 replacement battery which is 6mm thick.
